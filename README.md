# YTDL
Easy and free YouTube music downloader

How to use?
-----------
Open the `download.bat`, and pate the YouTube link, or video ID, than hit `<ENTER>`.
The script will download it, convert and save it into the Music>Today_date folder.

Sometimes there is an error with the downloading, caused by maintance/upgrade at YT.
The `patch.bat` will solve this problem for you, just run it.

Copyright and things
--------------------
These executable files are just copies. If you don't trust, you can download those from there :D
- I found the `ffmpeg.exe` and the `ffprobe.exe` at https://ffmpeg.org
- I found the `youtube-dl.exe` at https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html

Filelist
--------
The following files are neccessary for working, but the GitHub doesn't let me upload 2 executable for some reason, so you have to download them from the links above. Sry for that.
- `download.bat`
- `ffmpeg.exe`
- `ffprobe.exe`
- `patch.bat`
- `youtube-dl.exe`
